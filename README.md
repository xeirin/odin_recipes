# TOP Recipe HTML Project
Just applying the HTML lessons into a website for dessert recipes. Experimenting with the elements and tags were fun.
<p>Was able to test out how to stage and commit and kinda understand how it works more.</p>

<p>Pretty easy overall and a good way to refresh all the lessons on HTML.</p>
